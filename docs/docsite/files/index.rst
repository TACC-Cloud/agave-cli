Data Management: File Operations
================================

Data is managed using the files service of the Agave CLI. 
With many parallels in Linux file commands (ls, mv, cp, rm, etc.), 
Agave files-* commands can be used to list files, upload and download data, remotely manage and organize data, and import external data from the web.

Agave files-* commands act on Agave storage systems. 
See the systems basics documentation for more details.
