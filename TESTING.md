# Testing

This document contains the code testing guidelines for the `agave-cli`.
It should answer any questions you may have as an aspiring Agave contributor.

## Test suites
The `agave-cli` relies on [`TACC/agavepy`](https://github.com/TACC/agavepy) and
will be merged with it eventually.
The core functionality is already tested in `TACC/agavepy`.
